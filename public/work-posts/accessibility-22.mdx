I participated in the Microsoft AI for Accessiblity, developing a solution to better the world for the blind.

My team's solution was Bright Up -- AI Assistant for cooking. We were 1 of the 11 finalists from teams all over
the world. Even though we didn't get any prize at the end, it was a valuable experience and a great inspiration
to advocate for equality in the society.
