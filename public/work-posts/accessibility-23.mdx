Once again, we participated in the Microsoft AI For Accessibility 2023.
This time, we truly put an effort in empathising and understanding the blind.
We came up with the project 'NEON', a generative AI for presentation generation,
designed with accessibility in mind.

&nbsp;

As a result, DevA got first place from the competition ðŸŽ‰,
becoming the representative of Thailand.
