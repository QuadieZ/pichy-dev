Recently in Mid-November, I and my team participated in the Bangkok AI Hack organized by SCB10X as one of the 18 finalists. I have so little experience with AI, and most of my time coding goes into websites or games. We were able to deliver what we set out to do, and even though we didnâ€™t win, we learned so much in the span of 10 days.
