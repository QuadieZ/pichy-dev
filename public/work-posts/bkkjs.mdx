My first time organizing a tech event, and also attending one!

&nbsp;

BKK.js is an offline event inviting JavaScript Developers and enthusiasts
to update trends, projects, and exchange experience.

&nbsp;

I was responsible for the venue in this event, along with some other
minor tasks. It was a great experience
