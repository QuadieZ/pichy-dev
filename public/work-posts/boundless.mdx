Boundless Entrepreneurship is a university-wide event from the joint effort of DevA,
[UCAN](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090000707117), Hatch KMUTT, and student affairs. It features a lot of activities such as

ðŸ“Œ Talks and Lightning Talks

ðŸ“Œ Workshops

ðŸ“Œ Marketplaces

ðŸ“Œ Pitching Stage

&nbsp;

I was responsible for overall organization, contacting speakers, and graphic designs.
This was my first time organizing an event of this scale.
There were a lot of positive feedback and things to improve,
but it was a successful event overall.
