After I joined CAI Camp Gen3, I also received a membership of CAI Club,
where the camp's alumnus gathered to work on projects and community building.
I initiated a tech-focused Hackathon for high shool students from all over Thailand to hack AI for Youth.

&nbsp;

The event got supports from various companies such as CPALL, Nestl√©, Lactasoy, GoSoft,
along with good feedbacks from the participants and sponsors.

&nbsp;

I also gave keynote session about how to pitch in competition along with DevA teammates as well.

&nbsp;

I'm proud to say that this event will be continued, and you can find the details about it [here](https://www.facebook.com/caicamp)
