CAI Camp is a camp organized by CPALL as a bootcamp for high school students to learn
about Artificial Intelligence. I was in the third generation, the first that's Online.
I went through intensive 2 months workshops involving artificial intelligence, machine learning,
and GO class to develop logical thinking.

&nbsp;

Along with the workshops, we also worked on projects for the final presentation.
My team's project was using blockchain and artificial intelligence to solve energy issues of
retail stores. I was responsible for front-end website development, and our team got the first place
runner-up award.

Project Repositories: [Blockchain](https://github.com/QuadieZ/envAlt-blockchain) | [Front-end](https://github.com/QuadieZ/envAlt-website) | [Back-end](https://github.com/QuadieZ/envAlt_backend)

This was a great opportunity to jump-start into artificial intelligence.
