During my first year in KMUTT, I really, really wanted to go study abroad,

&nbsp;

in Japan.

&nbsp;

I didn't get selected ðŸ¥²

&nbsp;

Heartbroken, I decided to apply for the SEED Scholarship, an exchange program in Canada,
just because I had the documents ready.

&nbsp;

I was accepted and awarded with a scholarship, which will be my first time going
abroad for such a long time (one semester) in a country I didn't know much about.

&nbsp;

Turns out Canada is a very nice place! The Lakehead University I went to was in Thunder Bay,
where I experienced extremely cold winter for the first time. I learned a lot, academically
and about life in general. I learned how to adapt, make new friends, improve my English, and
how to live on my own. I also decided to participate in the Pitch-it competition.
Even though I didn't win, it was a valuable experience for me to pitch on a foriegn stage.

&nbsp;

4 Months passed by in a blink of an eye. I studied hard, play hard, and live my life.
It's a great experience I would recommend trying to apply.
