I participated in the Cross-cultural Engineering Project at Shibaura Institute of Technology, Omiya Campus, Japan.

&nbsp;

ðŸ‘‰ We used system design and design thinking to solve the problem of job hunting and the internship process in Japan.

See our project proposal [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF3fd6hSY8/S8Ovc_g7It9XQjUf9D8J4w/view?utm_content=DAF3fd6hSY8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)

ðŸ‘‰ We also participated in a hackathon to develop a solution for local tourism in Nasu using Mapbox
