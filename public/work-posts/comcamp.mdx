Comcamp is a camp organized by university students to introduce the department of computer engineering
to high school students from all over Thailand.

&nbsp;

I was the vice president of the camp, who was responsible for the overall picture of the camp. I also
contributed to front-end of the registration [website](https://github.com/Keetawin/ComCamp33_KMUTT) as well.

&nbsp;

It was online during my year, but it was still a great memory.
