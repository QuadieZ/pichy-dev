Coming back from the exchange program, I continued to volunteer in the Education for the Deaf (Edeaf) project, where vocation education is provided
for the deaf (น้องหู).

I was in the learning and development (LD) team, whose responsible was to collect feedbacks and
support the Volunteer Teachers (VT) to deliver the best class to the students.

This season's classes were shorten to 2 weeks, but I had great experience because not only the students
are deaf, we had a deaf teacher in the subject I was assigned to as well.
