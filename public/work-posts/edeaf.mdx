I volunteered in the Education for the Deaf (Edeaf) project, where vocation education is provided
for the deaf (น้องหู).

I was in the learning and development (LD) team, whose responsible was to collect feedbacks and
support the Volunteer Teachers (VT) to deliver the best class to the students.

This inspires me in my projects for accessibility later on
