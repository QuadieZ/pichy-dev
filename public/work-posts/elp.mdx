Experiential Learning Program (ELP) is a program to cultivate entrepreneurial mindset
in students. 800+ Students all over Thailand went through bootcamps and pitching selection
until 35 are selected to go to startup incubation abroad.

&nbsp;

I am proud to say that I am one of the 35 and will be going to Nanyang Polytechnic, Singapore.

Through out 2 weeks, I learned about design thinking, business model canvas, pitching, and more.

I also got to meet Singaporean students and successful entrepreneurs, and take the key learnings back to Thailand.
