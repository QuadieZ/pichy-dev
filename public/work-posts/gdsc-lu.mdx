I didn't make it in time to register for core team of Google Developer Student Club at KMUTT.

&nbsp;

So, I decided to join GDSC at Lakehead University, Canada!

&nbsp;

I was the graphic designer of the club, responsible for any graphic needs for the club.
I also helped organised the activities for LU students during my stay there.

&nbsp;

It wasn't a long time, but it was a great club to join especially if you're a developer.
