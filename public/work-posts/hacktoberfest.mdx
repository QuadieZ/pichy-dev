The Hacktoberfest event is a global open-source contribution challenge held each year in October
to introduce and incentivize people to contribute to open-source software.

&nbsp;

I was the OD (One-day Director) of the event, whose responsibility was to oversee the
overall of the event and make decision to solve any problems. This was my first time
doing this kind of work outside of school, and it led to my journey as an Developer Advocate.
