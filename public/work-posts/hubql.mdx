I interned as a Developer Advocate at Hubql, an early stage startup that aims to build & visualize your

data schemas together with your team.

&nbsp;

During my internship, I got opportunity to organize events to promote the product, and also to contribute

to the product development in the front-end side. I got to work with Next.js, state management with Zustand,

graph with React Flow, and more. One of my proud contributions was implementing auto layout feature using React Flow and Elk.

&nbsp;

The event I organized was the [Supercharge: 10x your Developer Productivity with GenAI & Hubql](https://youtu.be/RCoEUh7WLo0?si=Mvoj7GoBrspXi0o-).

The event included panel discussions, workshop, and networking sessions.
