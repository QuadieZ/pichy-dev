KMUTT Global Game Jam is an annual event that gathers students from various faculties to create games in 48 hours. This year, the event was held on 26-28 Jan 2024.

&nbsp;

This year theme was 'Laugh'. I wanted to play with the theme and create a game that is unexpected. So my team
decided on a horror game, 'Laugh, or Die'.

&nbsp;

The game incorporates the theme by using laughter as a mechanic. The player must laugh to survive by laughing into the microphone when an anomaly appears. At the
same time, the player must also complete the puzzle to finish the day. I was the lead game developer, and developed the game with
Godot.
