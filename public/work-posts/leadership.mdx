KMUTT International Leadership Camp is a camp to cultivate leadership in students and
offer an opportunity for international students to meet up and exchange ideas about SDGs.

&nbsp;

I was one of the leaders of the camp, whose responsibility was to host activities and
facilitate participants.

&nbsp;

One notable activity I want to mention is 'Bingo Scavenger Hunt'. It is a website I
created for this camp. There is an authentication feature where participants can log in
to their team's account. They can take pictures and upload it for each prompt through
the website to try to complete the bingo.

&nbsp;

Stack: React, Chakra UI, Axios, Mongoose

Other than that, it was a great chance to improve my leadership and practice my conversational
English with other foreign and international friends.
