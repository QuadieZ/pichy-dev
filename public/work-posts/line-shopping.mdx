I was selected to be part of the LINE Shopping Incubator program. It was a great opportunity to learn from industry experts and work on a real-world project.

&nbsp;

My team worked on 'EVOLVE', a storefront manager for small businesses. It features

âœ… Authentication - Integrated with LINE LOGIN API

âœ… Product management - Integrated with LINE SHOPPING API

âœ… Killing feature - Storefront theme customization and website builder

This allows small businesses to create their online store with ease, stands out, and be memorable for customer.

EVOLVE was built with Next.js, Chakra UI, Supabase, and React beautiful dnd.

&nbsp;

Our efforts were recognized, and we were awarded the second runner-up.
