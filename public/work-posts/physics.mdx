I've always enjoyed arts & crafts when I was in high school, and since this would probably be the last time
I do something like this

(and it is, I rarely do crafts now that I'm a programmer), I decided to go all out.

This was a term-project with all the physics formula for high school. I made a book (hard-cover!) with
a website game for review. I spent around 3-4 months on this, which was too much time for a project
honestly, but I'm proud of it.
