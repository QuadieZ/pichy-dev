Innovation for KMUTT Sustainability is a Hackathon by KMUTT and Hatch for students to showcase their innovation ideas to improve and advocate sustainability for the university.

Our team project is called 'R2Sus' or Race to Sustainability, a gamified website where students can do quests, activities, and take course about sustainability. We were the second runner-up of the competition with total of 20,000 baht funding.
