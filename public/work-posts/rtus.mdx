ReThink Urban Spaces was a project for youth to come together, identify urban challenges,
and make an effort to solve them.

My group's interest was equality and safety for children in local communities. We chose
Trok Salak Hin (ตรอกสลักหิน) as our target, and conducted 3-weeks activities to engage children
and teach them about safety.

&nbsp;

We also exchanged our ideas with youth from Europe and exhibit our work at BACC Bangkok.

&nbsp;

Other than my groups, there were also other groups working for different urban issues
from all over Thailand.
