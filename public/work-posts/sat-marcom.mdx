As if it wasn't enough participating activities in Canada,
I thought 'why not continue the activity in Thailand too?'

&nbsp;

And thus I apply for a core team position of a volunteering project,
Saturday School, where extracurricular courses are opened for students on Saturday.
I got the graphic designer position, and was responsible for

üñåÔ∏è Creating PR Graphics for social media

üñåÔ∏è Creating graphics for Big Day, the event where students showcase what they learned in the program

&nbsp;

This is a great project for anyone who likes to do social volunteering.
