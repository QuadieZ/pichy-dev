Imagine being introverted and one day suddenly decided to run for school president.

That was me in my last high school year.

&nbsp;

I wouldn't say I did good during my time as the president, but I tried my best despite many limitations.
I also learned and grew a lot along with my team.

Some of the projects we did

ğŸ‘‰ Line Bot for activities, lunch, appointments

ğŸ‘‰ Gather students' requests and present to the school's board
