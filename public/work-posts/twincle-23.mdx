Twincle Program is a short-term exchange program for students to exchange cultures and for
Japanese education students to have experience teaching abroad.

&nbsp;

The first phase of the program, I received the scholarship to go to Japan for 9 days to give
feedback and prepare Japanese students for classes in Thailand. I also participated in Physics
Lab Session as well. I got to travel around, eat Japanese food, and practice
Japanese during my time there. I also presented in the International Research Conference,
where I present about my sentimental analysis project.

&nbsp;

The second phase was in Thailand, where Japanese students come to Thailand for 12 days,
also for cultural exchange and to teach high school students in Thailand.
I assisted them and showed them around during their time here.

&nbsp;

It was a great program for both parties, especially if you're majoring in education.
