With support from Hatch KMUTT, DevA initiated the event 'KMUTT Startup Playground',
a playground for students to try out their startup ideas with mentorship and funding.

&nbsp;

This was an invaluable experience for DevA, where we learned that 4 people are not enough
for organising eventsðŸ¥² I addition to doing pretty much anything organising event has to do,
I was also the mentor for the participant teams as well. I was surprised I was able to give
decent advice to the team from all of my startup and Incubation experiences.
It inspired me to continue improving myself so that I can share my knowledge to others.
