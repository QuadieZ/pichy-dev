I participated in a food innovation contest along with my high school friends,
a group where no one studied anything related to food science.

&nbsp;

We created a sustainable seasoning powder inspired by Thai literature and wore
Thai costumes to presentation because why not. It was fun, and we came back with
the second runner-up prize.
