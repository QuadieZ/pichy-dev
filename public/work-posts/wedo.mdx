WEDO Young Talent Program (YTP) is a program designed for students to try hands-on work
in a real work environment. 50 Finalists were chosen from 200+ candidates through bootcamp,
video interview, and 2-days hackathon.

I was one of the finalists selected. Even though I had to turn down the internship offer
because I was currently working with Brikl, I had learned a lot throughout the program.
