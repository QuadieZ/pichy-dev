World School International Forum or WSIF is an event initiated by a Japanese High School
where students from over 22 countries gathered to exchange cultures and ideas to solve
pressing issues of our world. I was one of the selected three delegates to participate
in WSIF2019 held in Romania. In addition to the activities and cultural exchange,
I also contribute to the research under the topic of "Healthy Food: From Consumption
to Consumerism" where we brainstorm issues, solutions, and produced medias to
raise awareness about the topic.
